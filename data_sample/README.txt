If you collect the IMU data using the same code that we provide in this project, please save and keep all of 
your data with the same form of 60_data file. 

Then run(For each sub dataset, you need to change the path of each sub-dataset every time you run this code.)
python txt_process.py

After you get the same form just like the 60_data shows, then run:
python Classification.py 

You will get the result of your SVM model.
